### Lecture Grade Breakdown
Lecture is worth 700 points with the following breakdown:

|Graded Component|Description|Points|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Exams|There will be three mid-term lecture exams (175 pts each). Your lowest mid-term exam score will be dropped.  You will have 60 minutes to complete each exam.  There will be ~40 multiple choice questions.  You will need a scantron form (882-E) and a #2 pencil. Because I drop your lowest exam score, no make-up exams – no exceptions. Please take care of restroom needs before the exam.  You will not be permitted to leave the exam once you start.  If you arrive late to an exam, you will only have the time remaining to complete the exam. If you arrive to an exam so late that some people have finished, you will not be able to take the exam. If you have a cell phone out during an exam, it will be considered cheating.|350 pts.|
|Final Exam|The final exam will cover the remaining material and have a comprehensive portion.  You must take the final exam as scheduled.  You may not drop the final exam as your lowest exam score. It's format will be similar to the other exams, but slightly longer|200 pts|
|Biology Study Skills|These assignments were designed to help you learn methods to help you succeed in this class and in future classes.  TODO please see ___ for more information|50 pts|
|In-class assignments, homework, online assignments, participation (IHOP)|These are designed to help you improve your study skills, assess your own understanding and to learn the material.  I am not looking for perfection.  If you score 90% or above on these assignments, you will receive full credit for the IHOP.  IHOP assignments are never accepted late.|100 pts.|


1.	Participation – Attendance will count toward this grade.  Tardiness may result in reduced points.
2.	In-class assignments – A variable number of in-class assignments will be assigned throughout the term.  You must be present to complete in-class assignments.  These cannot be made up – no exceptions.  
3.	Online assignments – There are questions sets for each chapter available through the quizzes function on D2L.  You may take these multiple times – your average score will be recorded.  They are due before each exam.  
4.	Homework – Other assignments may be assigned to be completed on your own.

#### Lab Grades

BI 112 lab is worth 30% of your course grade, and the lecture is worth the remaining 70% of your grade.

|Item|Details|Total Points|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Quizzes|7 @ 20 pts each, lowest score dropped|120 pts|
|Postlab Homework Assignments|10 @ 10 pts each|100 pts|
|Skills Test|1 @ 30 pts|30 pts|
|Microworlds Project|5 @ 10 pts each|50 pts|
|**Total**||300 pts|

_Quizzes_
 - There are seven weekly quizzes (starting from week 2). Each quiz take place first thing on Wednesday lab, **except for week 2's quiz, which will be on Monday because of the July 4 holiday**.
 - Each quiz is worth 20 points.  Your lowest quiz score is dropped.  
 - Quizzes are given during the first 10 to 15 minutes of class.  If you are late, you have only the time remaining to complete the quiz.  Students must take the quiz during the scheduled quiz time - **there are no early or make up quizzes**.
 - The material covered in the previous lab(s) will be tested on the quiz. Each quiz's content will resume where the last quiz's coverage ended. In addition, there may be a few questions about measurements and/or the metric system.
 - These quizzes are challenging!  This is how we assess your understanding of the lab material.  The questions in the lab, the practice questions, and the homework assignment can help you prepare for the quiz.  

_Postlab homework assignments_
 - There are 10 post-lab homework assignments.
 - Each post-lab is worth 10 points.  
 - Post-labs are due at the beginning of the lab (except for postlabs 9 and 10, which are due in class at the end of lab).
 - The content covered comprises ~80% from material from the previous lab and ~20% from the current week’s lab.  
 - These are to be your own work.
 - The postlabs may be marked down up to 75% for the following reasons:
   - Student arrives after exercise starts or student leaves before exercise finishes: -25%
   - Student is present but does not participate fully: -25%
   - Student does not clean up after themselves or their group: -25%
 - If you do not attend a lab, you cannot receive credit for that lab’s postlab assignment (i.e., you must complete a lab to get credit for the homework).

_Microworlds_
 - In BI 112, we want you to master the use and care of the microscope. We expect you to learn how to find and focus on objects in the microscope field of view, to record details of the sample preparation, to draw the sample, take notes about the sample, and to estimate its size.
 - There are 5 microworld projects due by the end of the term.  Due dates vary TODO flesh out?.
 - These must be your own work.

Skills test:
•	Please see separate handout TODO link to it

#### Attendance and Participation

Full participation in lab is a requirement for BI 112.  Attendance means completing the assigned exercises, participating in activities that require group effort, recording observations and data in your lab manual, and cleaning up when you are finished.  I will keep track of your participation, so please do not leave lab early.  If you do not participate fully or you come in late/leave early, you will not receive full credit for that week’s homework.
In the event that you need to miss a lab, please contact me in advance.  You can attend another lab section during the same week (at the same campus) and the points of that quiz will be counted as a normal quiz.  Please contact the instructor of the lab you would like to attend in advance and ask permission (include me in the email).  Please note: the instructor is not required to let you attend their lab.**Class Cancellation**: In the event that a lab is cancelled, your instructor will explain how the homework, quiz, etc. for that lab will be managed.

Note: Labs that are cancelled due to college schedules, weather, or other unanticipated events may result in slight deviations from the schedule, but it is our intention to keep the point distribution close to the original values.

---
#### Late work

If you miss a lab, I will accept the postlab that was due the day you missed during the next week at the beginning of class without penalty.  All other late postlabs will be marked down 10% each **day** they are late.  You are encouraged to turn in late work electronically.

Late lab work will not be accepted after 1 week of its due date.

If you do not attend a lab, you cannot receive credit for that lab’s postlab assignment.

No materials will be accepted during finals week.

#### Incompletes
A student may receive an I for a course if they miss an essential part of the class for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor (Trips out of town for vacation, family reunions, or work are not acceptable reasons). To be eligible for an incomplete, the student must have completed 90% of the course with a grade of C or better.  The I grade is not substitution for substandard performance.  To receive an I, the student and the instructor must sign a written agreement and submit a copy with the division administrative staff.  ---
#### Dropping/Withdrawing and Grade Options
Pay attention to the college deadlines for withdrawing from the course or electing a P/NP or Audit option. You are responsible for learning what the options are, and exercising them within the designated time period.  A "W" grade will be granted to the student who has followed established school procedures for properly withdrawing from the course within the specified time limits (consult your PCC Schedule of Classes).  	You may change to Audit or Pass/No Pass up until the dates specified in the schedule of classes.

#### Sanctuary College
PCC is a sanctuary college.  For more information, see [www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/](www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/).

---
#### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work. Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, and working with others to cheat are all forms of academic dishonesty. This includes submitting work that is identical (or nearly so, based on the judgment of the instructor) to that of another student, even when completed in the context of “group” work. Various penalties may be imposed and a fair hearing process is in place. Refer to Academic Integrity Policy, which is in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, accessible from the PCC home page under Resources.
