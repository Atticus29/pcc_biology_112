#### Course DescriptionIncludes the study of the scientific method, cellular chemistry, cell structure and function, principles of inheritance, and laboratory skills. Includes topics and skills required to continue to Anatomy & Physiology and Microbiology.  Prerequisites: WR 115, RD 115, and MTH 65 or equivalent placement test scores. Audit available.

---
#### Intended Outcomes for the course
A student will collaboratively and independently:

- Analyze their individual thinking and learning styles & how their styles can be integrated with methods used in science.- Use an understanding of biological and chemical principles of cell function as a base for further learning in the health sciences.- Build on the laboratory research experience to organize data and information in order to draw conclusions and identify new investigative paths.- Use scientific vocabulary and an understanding of the scientific method to critically evaluate current health issues in our society.

#### Lab Instruction Materials
- Biology 112 Laboratory Manual, Rock Creek 2017-2018.  This manual is meant to be written in; a new copy is essential.

#### Attendance and Participation

Full participation in lab is a requirement for BI 112.  Attendance means completing the assigned exercises, participating in activities that require group effort, recording observations and data in your lab manual, and cleaning up when you are finished.  I will keep track of your participation, so please do not leave lab early.  If you do not participate fully or you come in late/leave early, you will not receive full credit for that week’s homework.
In the event that you need to miss a lab, please contact me in advance.  You can attend another lab section during the same week (at the same campus) and the points of that quiz will be counted as a normal quiz.  Please contact the instructor of the lab you would like to attend in advance and ask permission (include me in the email).  Please note: the instructor is not required to let you attend their lab.**Class Cancellation**: In the event that a lab is cancelled, your instructor will explain how the homework, quiz, etc. for that lab will be managed.

Note: Labs that are cancelled due to college schedules, weather, or other unanticipated events may result in slight deviations from the schedule, but it is our intention to keep the point distribution close to the original values.

---
#### Late work

If you miss a lab, I will accept the postlab that was due the day you missed during the next week at the beginning of class without penalty.  All other late postlabs will be marked down 10% each **day** they are late.  You are encouraged to turn in late work electronically.

Late lab work will not be accepted after 1 week of its due date.

If you do not attend a lab, you cannot receive credit for that lab’s postlab assignment.

No materials will be accepted during finals week.

#### Students with Disabilities
 PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, you must meet with the instructor privately and in-person to discuss your needs. Accommodations are not retroactive; they can only after you meet with the instructor and the instructor receives the “Approved Academic Accommodations” letter. To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact a disability services counselor on any PCC campus. Additional information may be located at [www.pcc.edu/resources/disability](www.pcc.edu/resources/disability).

#### Extra credit
As a matter of department policy, there will be no extra credit assignments or activities.
---
#### Incompletes
A student may receive an I for a course if they miss an essential part of the class for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor (Trips out of town for vacation, family reunions, or work are not acceptable reasons). To be eligible for an incomplete, the student must have completed 90% of the course with a grade of C or better.  The I grade is not substitution for substandard performance.  To receive an I, the student and the instructor must sign a written agreement and submit a copy with the division administrative staff.  ---
#### Dropping/Withdrawing and Grade Options
Pay attention to the college deadlines for withdrawing from the course or electing a P/NP or Audit option. You are responsible for learning what the options are, and exercising them within the designated time period.  A "W" grade will be granted to the student who has followed established school procedures for properly withdrawing from the course within the specified time limits (consult your PCC Schedule of Classes).  	You may change to Audit or Pass/No Pass up until the dates specified in the schedule of classes.

#### Sanctuary College
PCC is a sanctuary college.  For more information, see [www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/](www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/).

---
#### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work. Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, and working with others to cheat are all forms of academic dishonesty. This includes submitting work that is identical (or nearly so, based on the judgment of the instructor) to that of another student, even when completed in the context of “group” work. Various penalties may be imposed and a fair hearing process is in place. Refer to Academic Integrity Policy, which is in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, accessible from the PCC home page under Resources.

#### TODO Details
 - Is there a finals weeks during the summer quarter?
 - Make up quizzes for absences are never allowed.
 - NO GROUP quizzes
 - Homework due during the beginning of lab. If more than 10 min. late, treated as a late assignment (~80% from lecture content, ~20% from lab content)
 - The homework may be marked down up to 75% for the following reasons:    - Arrive after exercise starts or leave before exercise finishes: -25%    - Are present but do not participate fully: -25%    - Do not clean up after yourself or your group: -25%    - Do not put microscope properly: -25%
