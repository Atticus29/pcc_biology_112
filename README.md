## Course Info
BI 112 is a laboratory science course designed as a prerequisite for pre health professions students who plan to take microbiology and/or anatomy and physiology at PCC. Includes the study of the scientific method, cellular chemistry, cell structure and function, principles of inheritance, and laboratory skills. Includes topics and skills required to continue to Anatomy & Physiology and Microbiology. Audit available. Prerequisites: WR 115, RD 115, and MTH 65 or equivalent placement test scores.

### Evaluation
BI 112 is a 5 credit course; co-enrollment in a Lab section is required. The lecture is worth 70% of the final grade; lab will be worth 30% of the final grade.

### Attendance
For BI 112, a key ingredient to your success will be attendance. It is your responsibility to arrive at lecture _on time_ and prepared to learn. There will occasionally be assignments that are completed in class. You must be in class to complete these assignments and to receive credit for them. There will be no makeup assignments – no exceptions.

### Lecture Instruction Materials
- Campbell-Biology in Focus-Custom edition for PCC, ISBN 9781323766248 (Taken from Campbell-Biology in Focus Urry et al., 2nd ed., Pearson.)
    - The textbook changed in Fall, 2017, so older versions are unfortunately not suitable for the course anymore.
    - You can use the MasteringBiology companion online. There are a lot of resources available for practice problems. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yVWFe9zlXYtiq2JqQyJHAt_k1bVz5uFxi8Vl-Hjqe0/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on setting up an account. The Course ID for this course is: **MBFISHER7689227**.

#### Socrative

- We will take advantage of a student response system called [Socrative](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/). The Room Name is **FISHER2070**. We will be using this tool to assess your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet. If you can, please bring such a device to class every day. **If you are unable to do this, please let me know as soon as possible**.

### Lecture Grade Breakdown
Lecture is worth ~700 points (this is subject to slight variation) with the following breakdown:

|Graded Component|Description|Total Points|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Exams|There will be three in-class lecture exams (175 pts. each). Your lowest in-class exam score will be dropped. You will have 60 minutes to complete each exam. There will be ~40 multiple choice questions and several (usually ~10) short answer questions on each exam. You will need a scantron form (882-E) and a #2 pencil. Because I drop your lowest exam score, **there are no make-up exams – no exceptions**. Please take care of restroom needs before the exam. **You will not be permitted to leave the exam once you start**. If you arrive late to an exam, you will only have the time remaining to complete the exam. If you arrive to an exam so late that some people have finished, you will not be able to take the exam. If you have a cell phone out during an exam, it will be considered cheating.|350 pts.|
|Final Exam|The final exam will cover the material not covered in the other exams AND it will have a comprehensive portion. You must take the final exam as scheduled. You may not drop the final exam as your lowest exam score. Its format will be similar to the other exams, but slightly longer.|200 pts.|
|Biology Study Skills|These assignments are designed to help you learn methods to help you succeed in this class and in future classes. Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1d9N6OxcFaSIhcMX2pY9y0dqOKbdLDBZ-U2L0c-PnM/edit?usp=sharing) for more information|50 pts.|
|In-class assignments, homework, online assignments, participation (IHOP)|These are designed to help you improve your study skills, assess your own understanding, and learn the material. I am not looking for perfection. If you score 90% or above on these assignments, you will receive full credit for the IHOP. IHOP assignments are never accepted late.|100 pts.|
|**Total**|---|**700 pts.**|

Any variation in point distribution will be announced in class.

#### More details about the 3 lecture exams

Students rarely have the chance to ruminate on past answers and consider potential mistakes, which is a shame, because it's a great learning tool. Thus, upon completion of the exam, you will have the opportunity to re-take the exam with a partner with open notes and open internet. You will have one week to turn in your "what I should have said" (WISHeS) exam. You won't have access to your original answers until after you've turned in your WISHeS exam. 10% of the difference between your score on this version and your original score will be added to your original score.

#### More details about the IHOP component
1.	Participation – Attendance as measured by Socrative submissions will count toward this grade. Tardiness may result in reduced points. Active participation (beyond Socrative) will also factor into this component.
2.	In-class assignments – A variable number of in-class group assignments (usually administered through Socrative, but sometimes on paper) will be assigned throughout the term. You must be present to complete in-class assignments. These cannot be made up – no exceptions.
3.	Online assignments – There are question sets for each chapter available through the quizzes function on D2L. You may take these multiple times – your average score will be recorded. They are due before each exam. If it asks you for a password, the password is **fall2019**.
4.	Homework – Other assignments may be assigned to be completed; stay tuned.

### Lab Grade Breakdown

BI 112 lab is worth 30% of your course grade, and the lecture is worth the remaining 70% of your grade.

**You cannot pass the class without passing the lab portion**. If a student receives an F in the lab, they will receive an F for the class regardless of their score in lecture. If a student receives a D in the lab, they will receive a D or an F for the class depending on their lecture score. **Students who have more than 2 lab absences will receive an F for the course.**

NOTE: Students must pass BI 112 with a C or above to be admitted into courses for which BI 112 is a prerequisite.

Grade calculations: Please check on D2L to make sure your grades are entered correctly. If there are any discrepancies, please contact me immediately. I recommend you keep all of your returned tests and assignments in case a problem arises; instructors make mistakes all of the time!

|Item|Details|Total Points|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Quizzes|8 @ 15 pts. each, lowest score dropped (more details below)|105 pts.|
|Postlab Homework Assignments|9 @ 10 pts. each (more details below)|90 pts.|
|Graphing Assignment|1 @ 10 pts. (more details below)|10 pts.|
|Skills Test|1 @ 20 pts. (more details below)|20 pts.|
|Microworlds Project|5 @ 10 pts. each (more details below)|50 pts.|
|**Total**||275 pts.|

_Graphing Assignment_

The state of Oregon now mandates that we assess quantitative literacy in order to ensure that our Biology classes remain General Education classes (i.e., in order to ensure that this class is transferrable). I will publish more information about this assignment as the quarter goes on TODO.

_Postlab homework assignments_

 - There are 10 post-lab homework assignments.
 - Each post-lab is worth 10 points.
 - Post-labs are due at the beginning of the lab on **Wednesdays** (except for postlab 10, which is due in class at the end of lab).
 - The content covered comprises ~80% from material from the previous lab and ~20% from the current week’s lab.
 - These are to be your own work.
 - The postlabs may be marked down up to 75% for the following reasons:
   - Student arrives after exercise starts or student leaves before exercise finishes and/or exit tickets are shown to instructor: -25%
   - Student is present but does not participate fully: -25%
   - Student does not clean up after themselves or their group, including improperly putting the microscope away: -25%
 - If you do not attend a lab, you cannot receive credit for that lab’s postlab assignment (i.e., you must complete a lab to get credit for the homework).

_Quizzes_

 - There are nine weekly quizzes (starting from week 2). Each quiz take place first thing on **Wednesday** lab.
 - Each quiz is worth 15 points. Your lowest quiz score is dropped.
 - Quizzes are given during the first 10 - 15 minutes of class. If you are late, you have only the time remaining to complete the quiz. Students must take the quiz during the scheduled quiz time - **there are no early or make up quizzes**.
 - The material covered in the previous lab(s) will be tested on the quiz. Each quiz's content will resume where the last quiz's coverage ended. In addition, there will be a few questions about measurements and/or the metric system on each quiz.
 - **These quizzes are challenging**! This is how we assess your understanding of the lab material. The questions in the lab, the practice questions, and the homework assignment can help you prepare for the quiz.

_Microworlds_

 - In BI 112, we want you to master the use and care of the microscope. We expect you to learn how to:
	 -  find and focus on objects in the microscope field of view
	 -  record details of the sample preparation
	 -  draw the sample
	 -  take notes about the sample
	 -  estimate its size
	 -  practice the metric system

 - You are responsible for turning in 5 Microworld projects (there are 8 opportunities available) for the quarter. The worksheets can be found in the back of your lab manual. The due dates for each vary; I will be very communicative about this. See p. 157 (Appendix C) of your lab manual for more information.
 - These must be your own work.

_Microscope Skills Test_

- Once during the quarter, I'll be evaluating your ability to talk about, properly handle/use a microscope, and calculate sizes of objects observed in the field of view.
-	Please see (Appendix B) of your lab manual for more information and a checklist to help you prepare.
- The skills tests will be administered to you individually during lab time on one of the last four weeks of lab

#### Intended Outcomes for the Course
A student will collaboratively and independently:

- Analyze their individual thinking and learning styles & how their styles can be integrated with methods used in science.
- Use an understanding of biological and chemical principles of cell function as a foundation for further learning in the health sciences.
- Build on the laboratory research experience to organize data and information in order to draw conclusions and identify new investigative paths.
- Use scientific vocabulary and an understanding of the scientific method to critically evaluate current health issues in our society.

---
#### Attendance and Participation

Full participation in lab is a requirement for BI 112. Attendance means completing the assigned exercises, participating in activities that require group effort, recording observations and data in your lab manual, and cleaning up when you are finished. I will keep track of your participation using "exit tickets", which entail showing me various results and/or responses to questions or prompts from the lab. Leaving lab before showing me your exit ticket will result in loss of credit for the lab, so please do not leave lab without checking in with me. If you do not participate fully or you come in late, this will also result in some loss of participation credit.

In the event that you need to miss a lab, please contact me in advance. Instructors make a strong effort to coordinate which labs happen when, and you can often attend another lab section during the same week (at the same campus) and the points of that quiz will be counted as a normal quiz. Please contact the instructor of the lab you would like to attend in advance and ask permission; include me in the email. Please note: the instructor is not required to let you attend their lab. In an effort to reduce burden on instructors for labs later in the week, it is department policy that we only allow these "make-up" labs once per student per quarter.

**Class Cancellation**: In the event that a lab is cancelled, I will explain how the homework, quiz, etc. for that lab will be managed.

Note: Labs that are cancelled due to college schedules, weather, or other unanticipated events may result in slight deviations from the schedule, but it is our intention to keep the point distribution close to the original values. I will always alert you of any schedule updates on D2L.

---
### Late work, absences, extra credit, and missed exams

#### Late Assignments
All assignments are due at the _beginning of class_ on the due date unless otherwise noted. If you turn materials in late in class, even if you are just tardy or forgot to turn it in, they will be marked down as if they are a day late. Late assignments will be marked down 10% each **day** after the due date. Late assignments will not be accepted beyond 1 week of their due date. You are encouraged to turn in late work electronically if that expedites the process (photos are usually acceptable).

No late online assignments will be accepted. If you have computer problems, you must contact me before the due date. Note that computers are available on campus.

No materials will be accepted after the last day of class (i.e., no materials will be accepted during finals week).

#### Missed labs
If you miss a lab, I will accept the postlab that was due the day you missed during the next week's lab at the beginning of class without penalty. All other late postlabs follow the late assignment policy described above.

If you do not attend a lab, you cannot receive credit for that lab’s postlab assignment.

Make up quizzes for absences are never allowed.

#### Extra credit
As a matter of department policy, there will be no extra credit assignments or activities. This is beyond my control.

#### Missed exams
Because I drop your lowest exam score, no make-up exams are given – no exceptions!

If the student misses the final exam for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor, the instructor may assign an I (incomplete). The instructor is not required to administer a make-up final exam if the student misses the final exam for a reason that is not acceptable to the instructor and is not documented. The instructor reserves the right to administer a make-up final exam that differs from the original exam and/or to deduct points from the make-up final exam.

---

### Incompletes
A student may receive an I for a course if they miss an essential part of the class for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor (Trips out of town for vacation, family reunions, or work are not acceptable reasons). To be eligible for an incomplete, the student must have completed 90% of the course with a grade of C or better. The I grade is not substitution for substandard performance. To receive an I, the student and the instructor must sign a written agreement and submit a copy with the division administrative staff.

---
### Flexibility statementThe instructor reserves the right to revise the class calendar, modify content, and/or substitute assignments in response to institutional, weather, or class situations.

---
### Desire2Learn
Lecture material and quiz assignments as well as course announcements will all occur on D2L.
 **You are responsible for all information on Desire2Learn**. Please check it frequently.

### Re-grade policy

If you wish to dispute a grade, I will consider your request up to one full week after the assignment has been returned to you and you have access to solutions (whichever happens later). Requests for grade adjustments beyond the one-week deadline will not be considered.

Re-grade requests for assignments and exams will be handled online. In order for a re-grade to be considered, you must message me the following:

- Which question you want addressed
- What your answer was (exactly!). Photo or physical evidence may be required.
- Detailed justification for point recovery

Any requests that do not include ALL THREE things WILL NOT be reviewed. I use this re-grade policy because sometimes writing about the question helps students realize where the mistake was (this is certainly the case for me when I write about things), and it gives students time to write more diplomatic emails (and me more time to truly consider the request and write thoughtful, diplomatic responses).

This means that after-class re-grade ambushes will be met with frowns.

### Students with Disabilities
 PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, you must meet with the instructor privately and in-person to discuss your needs. Accommodations are not retroactive; they can only after you meet with the instructor and the instructor receives the “Approved Academic Accommodations” letter. To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact a disability services counselor on any PCC campus. Additional information may be located at [www.pcc.edu/resources/disability](www.pcc.edu/resources/disability).

### Title IX/Non-Discrimination statement
Portland Community College is committed to creating and fostering a learning and working environment based on open communication and mutual respect. if you believe you have encountered sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, age, national origin, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability please contact the Office of Equity and Inclusion at (971) 722-5840 or equity.inclusion@pcc.edu.

---
### Dropping/Withdrawing and Grade Options
Pay attention to the college deadlines for withdrawing from the course or electing a P/NP or Audit option. You are responsible for learning what the options are, and exercising them within the designated time period. A "W" grade will be granted to the student who has followed established school procedures for properly withdrawing from the course within the specified time limits (consult your PCC Schedule of Classes). You may change to Audit or Pass/No Pass up until the dates specified in the schedule of classes.

---
### Sanctuary College
PCC is a sanctuary college. For more information, see [www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/](www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/).

---
### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work. Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, and working with others to cheat are all forms of academic dishonesty. This includes submitting work that is identical (or nearly so, based on the judgment of the instructor) to that of another student, even when completed in the context of “group” work. Various penalties may be imposed and a fair hearing process is in place. Refer to Academic Integrity Policy, which is in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, accessible from the PCC home page under Resources.
[Code of Student Conduct](www.pcc.edu/about/policy/student-rights/student-rights.pdf#code-of-student-conduct)

---

### Academic Courtesy
Students must demonstrate respect for fellow students during the class period. Please keep in mind that your classmates may have beliefs and opinions that differ from your own. I expect you to show courtesy toward everyone.

Refrain from talking during lecture and other distracting behavior.

Please come to class on time. If you do come to class late, please try to be as unobtrusive as possible. If you must leave early, sit near the exit and try to wait for a break to leave. Leaving in the middle of lecture can be very disruptive.

Please feel free to have food and drink in the classroom as long as it is not disruptive; the same is **not** true of lab, of course.

Students are expected to help maintain the appearance of the classroom. Please discard all trash. This is Portland - y'all know the Leave No Trace mantra.

#### Academic Courtesy and Classroom Discussions

Questions and discussions are integral parts of this class!  We have ~4 hours of lecture each week and discussions help keep students (and the instructor!) engaged in the material. Many students learn new material by integrating it with their existing knowledge and by placing it in a specific and personal context. Therefore, some questions may sound ‘off-topic’ to some students because they have different view or understanding of the material. However, questions and comments that are not specifically in the book or notes may be just as important to student learning as questions directly from the material in the book.

On the other hand, please try to limit your questions to the section we are covering and respect other people in the class. Some questions may be more appropriate to discuss during office hours. Please keep in mind that all students have different learning styles. I teach to as many of these styles as possible while making sure we cover the necessary material to keep us on schedule; I may ask you to take a question "off air", in which case we can discuss it after lecture time or in office hours.

### Strategies for success in a biology class

Science doesn't come naturally to most people; it is a skill that is aquired, rather than an ability somebody either has or does not have. If this is your first collegiate science course, you might be surprised at the amount of time required to be successful.

- **Work hard during lectures** This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed. Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.


- **Be an active learner** Skim the book and lecture notes _before_  class. Come to all lectures. While you take notes in class, write down questions you have about the lecture or which are brought to mind by the lecture. Identify points in the lecture that you think are the main points. Review your notes shortly after class. Compare notes with a classmate. Do your notes agree? While you read, pause and reflect on the material. How does it fit with what you know already? Are  you memorizing facts or learning concepts?

- **Figure out and use your learning strengths** Knowing your learning style can help you in any class. Some people learn best by reading, others by writing, others by drawing, others by talking. Use the techniques that work best for you. (Even better, use a combination of techniques!)
	To learn more about student learning styles, go to http://www.learning-styles-online.com/,
http://www.personal.psu.edu/bxb11/LSI/LSI.htm, or http://www.edutopia.org/multiple-intelligences-learning-styles-quiz.

- **Participate in a study group** I know… you hate study groups. But talking about the material is an excellent way to assess your understanding. I encourage you to find a group that works for you. Former 112 students have reported that they were unlikely to succeed in A&P without study groups and that the connections they made in 112 were important to their success.

- **Learn from your mistakes** Take the practice tests and quizzes available through the text book. If you get something wrong, try to determine why. This is especially true for exams. Spend time analyzing your exam results. It’s easy to say the question was too difficult – it’s more effective to figure out why the question was difficult.

- **Take responsibility** You are the person in control of your performance in class. I don’t give you a grade - I just report the grade you earn.

- **Spend time on this course** Schedule and spend time at least every other day to read and review course materials, re-write your notes and think. Much of this course builds upon earlier portions of the course. Try your best not to fall behind.

- **Take advantage of the resources available to you** There are many services available to help you in all aspects of your education. Don’t forget that your book and the online content are excellent resources! You should take advantage of all the tools that come with your book.

- **Ask me for help if you get confused** Don’t be shy about asking questions in class! If you have a question, it’s likely that other students are wondering the same thing. Please come see me during office hours! I’m there to help you with the material.

- **Write to learn** This is probably my best (and least-often-followed-through?) advice. When you’re reading the chapter, write about each section after you’re done reading. When you’re studying for the exams, **write and answer your own practice exams**. You will be shocked how often the writing process helps you understand and/or realize when you don’t understand a topic. Write write write.

- **Success here = future rewards**  In BI 112 our goal is to make sure that you have a good background in basic biology and that you are well-prepared for the 200-level courses you will need to go on into the Health Sciences.
